Using advanced models, the system <strong>generated realistic tweets</strong> and made <strong>accurate predictions</strong> about their popularity. The model was designed to <strong>predict the number of likes with high accuracy</strong> and <strong>very fast processing time</strong>.",

I led the <strong>UI/UX design process</strong> using <strong>Figma</strong>, focusing on effective <strong>information organization</strong> and incorporating features like a <strong>stock-book</strong>, <strong>item approval/request dashboard</strong>, and <strong>login screen</strong>. The frontend was built using <strong>React.js</strong> with <strong>Material UI</strong> as the base framework.",

        "desc": "This project focused on <strong>segmenting objects from images</strong> using advanced segmentation models and <strong>calculating their cross-sectional area</strong> by counting pixels. It aimed to <strong>reconstruct a 3D point cloud</strong> from multiple 2D images and estimate the object's volume using the convex hull method. The use of a <strong>stereoscopic camera</strong> allowed for <strong>accurate depth calculation</strong>, and <strong>filters were applied to smoothen the output</strong>. The system achieved <strong>98% accuracy</strong> in volumetric weight calculation, with an inference time of <strong>1.5 seconds</strong>.",
